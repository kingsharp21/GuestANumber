## **`Gust A Number Game *my first game😍.*`**

---

### 🚥 About

The Game was built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is a one player game that requires the player to guest a number and type it into the input field. The game picks a random number without displaying it to the player. The player has 5 chances to guest the right number (the number the game picked) or else **GAME OVER**😢!
